**Expo Markers Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks. It is used in the surveillance domain. 

The dataset consists of 5200 images with 115510 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *marker green*, *marker blue*, *marker red*, and other: *marker black*.

Images in the Expo Markers dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *synthetic* (5000 images) and *real* (200 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Datagen Tech, Israel</span>.
